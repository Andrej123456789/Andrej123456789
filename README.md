More stuff about me > 
- I think Rust can have little better syntax
- I wrote two books
- I know how to use DaVinci Resolve, Kdenlive, Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Photoshop at level good enough to make something that looks good
- Project is dead if has `PROJECT IS DONE` label which means that I am done developing that project, but there is possibility that I might come back someday in future but probably not. Sometimes project can be dead without notice
- And btw I don't like web dev too much, it is ok but I am not in it

*Stats are not fully correct because decent amout of time I am programming in/for ringwormGO*
