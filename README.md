More stuff about me > 
- I think Rust could have little better syntax
- I wrote two books
- I know to use DaVinci Resolve, Kdenlive, Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Photoshop at level enough to make something that looks good
- If my project has this note (`PROJECT IS DONE`), then I am done developing that project. I might come back someday in future but probably not; sometimes project can be dead without notice
- And btw I don't like web dev too much, it is ok but I am not in it

*Status are not fully correct because most of time I am programming in/for ringwormGO*
